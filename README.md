Once this data is no longer within the domain, then the company is at serious risk The main concept is water marking. Digital watermarking is the process of embedding information into a digital signal, such as an image, video, or audio file, in a way that is imperceptible to the human senses but can be detected and extracted by special software or hardware. Watermarking can serve various purposes, such as identifying the owner or distributor of the content, tracking its usage and distribution, protecting against copyright infringement, and detecting tampering or unauthorized modifications
